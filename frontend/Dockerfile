# Multi-stage Dockerfile for building a JS frontend and serving it with nginx
# - Build stage uses Node to install deps and produce a production build
# - Runner stage uses nginx to serve the static files with an SPA-friendly config
#
# Usage:
#  docker build -t edna-frontend:latest .
#  docker run --rm -p 80:80 edna-frontend:latest
#
# Notes:
# - Expects a standard `npm run build` script that outputs to `dist/` (Vite and many other setups).
# - If your project builds to a different directory (e.g. `build/`), update the COPY from the builder accordingly.

# Install dependencies: try `npm ci` first (if lockfile present), fallback to `npm install`
RUN npm ci --silent --no-audit --prefer-offline || npm install --silent --no-audit

# Ensure NODE_ENV is set only after dependencies are installed so devDependencies (like Vite) are installed during build
ENV NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV}

# Copy source

# Build the production assets. Use `--if-present` so this won't fail for projects without a build script.

# Copy built assets from the builder stage to nginx html directory.
# Vite outputs to `/app/dist` by default — adjust if your build produces a different folder.

# Use project-provided nginx configuration instead of generating one.
# Place your `nginx.conf` in the build context so it will be copied into the image.

# Use the default nginx foreground cmd for Docker images
